This is a set of very concise lecture notes written for A-level further mechanics (syllabus code 9231). Presumably the target audience of the notes are students studying the relevant A-Level course. 

These notes are supposed to be self-contained. A handful of worked examples are included to give the reader some rough idea about how exam-style questions look like and how the principles developed in the note can be applied to solve them.

I also have to admit that these notes are far from complete. I hope you enjoy reading the notes. But if you spot any mistake (as I guarantee there will be a lot), please let me know.


Master file fmech-notes.tex references five chapters, each in separated tex files as suggested by file names.
